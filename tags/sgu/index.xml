If $f(n)$ is one-digit number then it is a digital root for $n$ and otherwise digital root of $n$ is equal to digital root of $f(n)$. For example, digital root of 987 is 6. Your task is to find digital root for expression $$ A_1\cdot A_2\cdots A_N + A_1\cdot A_2\cdots A_{N-1} + \cdots + A_1\cdot A_2 + A_1$$</description></item><item><title>SGU 117 - Counting</title><link>https://example.com/2015/02/sgu-117-counting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 24 Feb 2015 14:14:00 +0800</pubDate><author>作者</author><guid>https://example.com/2015/02/sgu-117-counting/</guid><description>Description Find amount of numbers for given sequence of integer numbers such that after raising them to the $M$-th power they will be divided by $K$.
